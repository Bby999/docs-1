# Understanding Roles

You can add people to your project and assign roles under the Team tab on Gitlocalize.

## Adding team members

1. Start typing the GitHub handle (username) of the person you want to add to your team. Their full username should appear in the dropdown list. In case that doesn't happen, the user you are trying to add does not have an account with GitLocalize. Please have them sign in with GitLocalize at least once using their GitHub account.

## Roles

### 1. Owner

This role is assigned by default to the user that created the project.

### 2. Admin

Admins can manage the team (add or remove users), create or close review requests, send pull requests with translations to GitHub.

### 3. Language Moderators
