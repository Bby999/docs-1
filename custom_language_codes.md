# Can I Specify Custom Language Codes for the Project Languages?

Custom language codes can be specified for each project language when creating a project or later in the Manage Languages section (available to Admins and Owner) in the Languages view. Language codes will replace the `%lang%` placeholder in the output paths (which affects the locations where translation files will be created).
