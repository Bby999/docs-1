# I want to use GitLocalize for a private repository. Will my project be private?

If you are using GitLocalize for a private repository, your GitLocalize project will also be private.
Users that are not added to the team will see a 404 error when trying to access the private project:

For this reason, you will need to make sure that each translator has access to your project by adding them to the team (see [Understanding Roles](/understanding_roles.html) for more information about roles and team members).

In contrast, if you are using GitLocalize for a public repository, your translation project will also be public. Any user can contribute to a public project, even if they are not part of the team. It makes it easier for community members to contribute to public translation projects.
