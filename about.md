# What is GitLocalize?

[GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com) is a continuous and automated localization platform that simplifies the workflow process for developers. 

Projects are always changing, and keeping them localized can be a daunting (and annoying) challenge. The makers of GitLocalize realized this and decided that nobody should have to suffer through this chore again. GitLocalize connects to your GitHub repository and seamlessly integrates with your development workflow in just a few clicks. 

## How It Works

You can immediately get started with your GitHub account. All you have to do is choose your repository to integrate with GitLocalize and it will localize your files. Here are the key features of the platform:

### GitHub Based Workflow

Once you integrate your repo with GitLocalize, it pulls the target files to its platform and makes them instantly translatable. It also begins to keep track of any changes between the original and translation files so you can update with ease.

After translating your file, simply send a review request to your team to discuss the updates as you would normally do with a pull request. Once it is reviewed and approved, you can send a pull request back to the repository. Each user's contribution on GitLocalize becomes their commit on the repository. 

With GitLocalize, your team will no longer dread localizing your project. Developers only need to look at the pull requests coming in. Let us take care of localization so you can focus on innovation.

### Diff management on translations

Since it automatically links a translation with its original sentence, it can show you which part needs to be translated when the original one is updated.

No need to manually check which parts are affected due to the original updated. You just need to look at GitLocalize editor and fill in the missing translations.

And of course, more features are lined up and will be shipped soon!
