# How to Contribute to Projects

Want to contribute to projects on GitLocalize but don't know how to? Follow these simple steps and you'll be contributing in no time! 

## 1. Find a Project

Of course, in order to contribute to a project, first you must find a project to contribute to! 

If you don't have a project of your own, try using the top search bar to filter projects by keywords related to your interests. You can also check out the home page to see [popular projects](https://gitlocalize.com).

## 2. Choose a Language

Once you've found a project you'd like to work on, navigate to its page. 

Here, you'll see a list of languages to translate the project to. The middle column tells you the moderator of each translation. The rightmost column tells you how much of the project has been translated to that language already.

Simply choose the language that you'd like to help with translating the project to.

## 3. Navigate to a File

Once you've selected your language, navigate to the file that you'd like to contribute to. Similar to the step above, the rightmost column tells you how much of each file has been translated already.

## 4. Translate

Now for the fun part! After selecting a file, simply click on a segment on the right side (translation side) that corresponds with the left side (original language side). 

Fill in your translation and submit it!

## 5. Conflict

If a translated file is far behind from the original file, GitLocalize shows it as a conflict status. In this case, click each segment and link to its parent segment.

## 6. Review Request & Pull Request

Once you finish translating a file, `Create Review Request` button will be shown up at the top. Click it to create a review request to notify your team that you have finished translating the file and start a discussion.

After the moderator finds your changes are goood to go, she will send a pull request to the repo. Check out the pull request to see if you get any feedbacks there.
