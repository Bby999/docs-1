# How to Contribute to Projects

Here to describe how to contribute projects on GitLocalize.

## 1. Find a project

If you don't have any project to contribute, let's search by keywords from the top search bar or check out the home page to see [popular projects](https://gitlocalize.com).

## 2. Choose a language

Once you navigate to a project page, you'll see a list of languages to translate. Choose a language you speak and want to contribute to.

## 3. Navigate to a file and translate

Navigate to a file that you want to contribute and haven't been finished translating yet.

Click a segment from the right section and submit your translation.

## 4. Conflict

If a translated file is far behind from the original file, GitLocalize shows it as a conflict status. In this case, click each segment and link to its parent segment.

## 5. Review Request & Pull Request

Once you finish translating a file, `Create Review Request` button will be shown up at the top. Click it to create a review request to notify your team that you have finished translating the file and start a discussion.

After the moderator finds your changes are goood to go, she will send a pull request to the repo. Check out the pull request to see if you get any feedbacks there.
