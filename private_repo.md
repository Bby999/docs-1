# Can I add a private repository to GitLocalize?

You should be able to add both public and private repositories on GitLocalize. However, in case the private repository you're trying to add is part of an organization, you need to have the Owner role in that organization to be able to add that repository.

In case you don't see your private repository in the dropdown list of available repos, please check your permissions in the GitHub organization or ask an organization owner to add the project on GitLocalize for you.

This is due to how our GitHub app is granted permissions to access the repository in your organization.
