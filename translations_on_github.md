# I have Translated a Document. When Will My Translation Go Live on GitHub?

Once you have submitted your translation for review (via a review request), the translation will be reviewed by a Language Moderator.
After the translation is reviewed and approved, the Language Moderator creates a pull request. Your translation will be live as soon as your pull request has been merged.

Pull requests can only be sent by Language Moderators assigned by the project owners.
